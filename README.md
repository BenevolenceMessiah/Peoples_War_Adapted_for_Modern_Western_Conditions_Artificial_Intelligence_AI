<h3>Premise of Hosting on GitHub:</h3>

It is necessary for these reasons and in keeping with the ideology to utilize these tools in order to facilitate our goals. GitHub is advantageous in that it can be collectively edited a number of ways. It can be Edited Via the dedicated Google Doc. Changes can be submitted via entering Comments in the Doc. Alternatively, if [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed - and if you plan on installing it now, make sure you tick the box to add Python to PATH - it may be edited locally in the browser and then saved to HTML or as PDF. I kept this very simple for beginners and kept everything to .bat files. I encourage opening the .bat in this Repo or via notepad or any text editor for additional documentation.

<h4>Installation Instructions:</h4>

1. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your corresponding system (When installing, make sure that the option to add Git Bash to the Shell Menu is ticked - it should be by default as I recall).
2. Right click, select 'open Git Bash here' where you'd like to install/download the thesis.
3. Paste:


	   git clone https://github.com/BenevolenceMessiah/Discourse_on_the_Emergence_of_Oligopical_Fascism.git
in the Git Bash console.

<h4>Updating:</h4>

This Thesis is expected to change frequently. It is advisable to update often. To update, run: `git pull` in the Git Bash console from inside of the folder where the project is now installed. Alternatively, just run the `Update_Windows.bat` or `Update_Mac.sh` script.

<h4>Usage:</h4>

To contribute edits, comments, or critiques, you can either run the `Submit_Edits_via_Google_Doc.bat` file (this will launch the mainbranch Google Doc), or, if you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed - and if you plan on installing it now, make sure you tick the box to add Python to PATH - it may be edited locally by running `Edit_Locally_on_Browser_Windows.bat` or `Edit_Locally_on_Browser_Mac.sh` (open a browser and type: http://localhost:6419/ if it doesn't open automatically) make your edits and then save as HTML or as PDF.

<h2>Abstract:</h2>

Current analysis of the material conditions of reality unveils a previously unencountered occurrence manifesting as another internal contradiction of capitalism, and more specifically, an internal contradiction to compound the already fatal series of internal contradictions associated with AI. This phenomenon can be understood as an instance wherein individual programmers, teams organizations, and the open source community at large have developed technology that is ‘running laps’ (according to the[ leaked internal Google document](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither)) around the Western tech industry in certain capacities involving the democratization and access of this technology involving the development of models that allow people (programmers and the lay alike), to access, train and utilize fully functional uncensored and specialized AI models that run on a local system – and this includes cheap consumer devices such as android phones and Raspberry Pi microprocessor units. The potential results of these changes are exceptionally impactful, especially concerning our disposition. Likewise, these potential use cases are extreme and variegated in themselves. For example, this constitutes a major shift in the ability to develop new ownership of the means of production – specifically with a technology that is incompatible with capitalism (due to the labor theory of value, depreciation of valuation, unemployment, inflation, etc. resulting from this automation process described by [Marx ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx)in his [Fragment on Machines](https://thenewobjectivity.com/pdf/marx.pdf)). To this end, there is an opportunity to attain exceptionally effective and groundbreaking automated community resources as well as the facilitation of a fully automated series of interlinked socialist enterprises. Therefore, I am advising and proposing an immediate focus ([people’s war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_war)) amongst revolutionary organizations in the study, development, improvement, integration, and general focus on [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) and its versatile implementations and use cases.

<h2>The Democratization of Technology in Latestage Capitalism</h2>

Capitalism is rife with internal contradicitons, and as capitalism progresses in it's stages of development, those internal contradicitons and internal paradoxes are exacerbated and magnified. Temporary liberal solutions give rise to more internal contradicitons and paradoxes leading to an ever more volatile and unstable material reality on a global basis. One of these prevalent internal contradicitons and fatal paradoxes is the the democratization of technology. There are many facets and occurences of this phenomenon - implications which are numerous and some which have not come to fruition yet. For our purposes, we will focus on some of the immediate, obvious, and larger implications. Multifaceted is an understatement. For example, if we were to look at something as base as 'automation' we could come up with a near infinite number of paradoxes from macro to micro economic implications. Topically, automation presents a paradoxical occurence in capitalism, functionally undoing it. Capitalism desires automation, and yet, automation kills capitalism. the short term increase in private accumulation of capital can be contrasted with a collapsing economy due to other internal contradictions - a decrease in socially productive labor in accordance with the [labor theory of value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value) - that is, less labor going into products causing an inherent devaluation in those products. The four different types of [alienation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation), a decreasing standard of living and erosion of rights, stagnating economy due to lower consumer parity of spending, etc.

<h2>AI: Post-scarcity Technology</h2>

AI itself, even in its current and limited implementation demonstrates a series of already evident internal and fatally paradoxical contradictions. AI demonstrates unique properties not before encountered in the mileu of human endeavors or technological advancements.
