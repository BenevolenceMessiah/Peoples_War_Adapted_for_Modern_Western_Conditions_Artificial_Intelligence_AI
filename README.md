Premise of Hosting on GitHub:

This point is expounded upon in my other Thesis <>, but it is necessary for these reasons and in keeping with the ideology to utilize these tools in order to facilitate our goals. GitHub is advantageous in that it can be collectively edited a number of ways. It can be Edited Via the dedicated Google Doc. Changes can be submitted via entering Comments in the Doc. Alternatively, if [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed - and if you plan on installing it now, make sure you tick the box to add Python to PATH - it may be edited locally in the browser and then saved to HTML or as PDF. I kept this very simple for beginners and kept everything to .bat files. I encourage opening the .bat in this Repo or via notepad or any text editor for additional documentation.

<h4>Installation Instructions:</h4>

1. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your corresponding system (When installing, make sure that the option to add Git Bash to the Shell Menu is ticked - it should be by default as I recall).
2. Right click, select 'open Git Bash here' where you'd like to install/download the thesis.
3. Paste: <code>git clone https://github.com/BenevolenceMessiah/Discourse_on_the_Emergence_of_Oligopical_Fascism.git</code> in the Git Bash console.

<h4>Updating:</h4>

This Thesis is expected to change frequently. It is advisable to update often. To update, run: `git pull`

in the Git Bash console from inside of the folder where the thesis is now installed. Alternatively, just run the `Update.bat`

script.

<h4>Usage:</h4>

To contribute edits, comments, or critiques, you can either run the `Submit_Edits_via_Google_Doc.bat` file (this will launch the mainbranch Google Doc), or, if you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed - and if you plan on installing it now, make sure you tick the box to add Python to PATH - it may be edited locally by running `Edit_Locally_on_browser.bat`

(open a browser and type: [http://localhost:6419/](http://localhost:6419/) if it doesn't open automatically) make your edits and then save as HTML or as PDF.

<h2>Abstract:</h2>

Current analysis of the material conditions of reality unveils a previously unencountered occurrence manifesting as another internal contradiction of capitalism, and more specifically, an internal contradiction to compound the already fatal series of internal contradictions associated with AI. This phenomenon can be understood as an instance wherein individual programmers, teams organizations, and the open source community at large have developed technology that is ‘running laps’ (according to the[ leaked internal Google document](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither)) around the Western tech industry in certain capacities involving the democratization and access of this technology involving the development of models that allow people (programmers and the lay alike), to access, train and utilize fully functional uncensored and specialized AI models that run on a local system – and this includes cheap consumer devices such as android phones and Raspberry Pi microprocessor units. The potential results of these changes are exceptionally impactful, especially concerning our disposition. Likewise, these potential use cases are extreme and variegated in themselves. For example, this constitutes a major shift in the ability to develop new ownership of the means of production – specifically with a technology that is incompatible with capitalism (due to the labor theory of value, depreciation of valuation, unemployment, inflation, etc. resulting from this automation process described by [Marx ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx)in his [Fragment on Machines](https://thenewobjectivity.com/pdf/marx.pdf)). To this end, there is an opportunity to attain exceptionally effective and groundbreaking automated community resources as well as the facilitation of a fully automated series of interlinked socialist enterprises. Therefore, I am advising and proposing an immediate focus ([people’s war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_war)) amongst revolutionary organizations in the study, development, improvement, integration, and general focus on [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) and its versatile implementations and use cases.
